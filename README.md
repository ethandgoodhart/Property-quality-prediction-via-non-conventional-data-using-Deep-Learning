Property quality prediction via non-conventional data using Deep Learning

Accurately deciding between travel accommodations is both a challenging and
time-consuming task with significant room for improvement. To help address this
challenge, I implemented a deep learning-based system that can predict various
accommodation quality proxies to be used as input by a consumer in the decision-
making process. Many existing works in the travel accommodation field focus on
tasks such as sentiment analysis over datasets of reviews or predicting property
demand, however, in this paper, I focus instead on building a user-facing model.
